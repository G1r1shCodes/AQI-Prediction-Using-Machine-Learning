# 🌍 AQI Prediction Web App

An interactive **Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction** app using **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Linear Regression) and built with **Streamlit**. Users can input air quality features and receive real-time AQI predictions.

## 📊 Features

- Predict AQI from environmental parameters
- User-friendly web interface using **Streamlit**
- Trained on 3 models:
  - **RandomForestRegressor**
  - **AdaBoostRegressor**
  - **LinearRegression**
- Visualization and metric comparison across models
- Modular and scalable project structure

## 🧠 How It Works

AQI is predicted based on input features using a trained regression model:

```python
AQI = (NO2 + CO + O3) / 3  # Simplified placeholder
````

The actual AQI model can be replaced with CPCB-compliant calculations for higher accuracy.

## 📊 Model Comparison

The models were evaluated using standard metrics:

| Model             | R² Score | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Linear Regression | 0.824    | 2.72                      | 3.28                           |
| Random Forest     | 0.951    | 1.29                      | 1.84                           |
| AdaBoost          | 0.931    | 1.41                      | 2.13                           |

📈 **Visual graphs** comparing actual vs predicted values and error plots are included in the notebook for better understanding.

## 📌 Abstract

This project aims to estimate the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using environmental features like CO, NO₂, O₃, temperature, and humidity. We trained three regression models on the **UCI Air Quality dataset** and compared their predictive performance. The model is deployed using Streamlit to make it accessible and interactive.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The `AirQualityUCI.csv` dataset from UCI repository was used.
2. **Preprocessing**:

   * Removed null and invalid values
   * Selected relevant pollutant and meteorological features
3. **Feature Engineering**:

   * AQI approximated using mean of pollutants (NO₂, CO, O₃)
4. **Model Training**:

   * Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regressors
5. **Evaluation**:

   * Compared R², MAE, RMSE on test data
   * Visualized predictions vs ground truth
6. **Deployment**:

   * Developed an interactive app using Streamlit
